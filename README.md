# flutter_quiz_app

During the 2021 summer I worked on an android based mobile game. I have used Flutter/Dart. I made a quiz
game that appeals to secondary school students from scratch. In the application, there are Login Screen,
Main Category Screen, Test Screen, Score Screen and there are several quizzes from Math, Literature, etc.
When the user completes the quiz he/she earns points. I gained a lot of experience in Front-end, Back-end,
OOP, Flutter Framework, Firebase/Firestore, and also Clean Code concept.
